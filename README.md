## Fullmet
A simple Tampermonkey userscript that enables HTML5 video controls on Google Meet's in-meeting video presentation.

### Features
- TLDR: allows you to toggle fullscreen when a presentation is ongoing
- Prevent triggering the distracting participant tooltip (the 3-in-1 unpin, mute, remove button) unless hovered at the center of the presentation screen/participant screen
